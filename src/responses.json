  "intro": "Hello! I am the Lab TA Chatbot, I am here to help you understand some of the reasons you might be receiving a Java error message! You will be able to ask me about several error messages, but we will go through them one at a time.",
  "format": "Before we get started, would you like me to go over Java error message formatting and the format necessary for me to answer your questions? (Recommended for first time users)",
  "err_info": [
    "Great! We will quickly run through the formatting for both compilation and runtime error messages! First, we will look at a compilation error:",
    "file_name.java:3: error: ';' expected\nString hello = \"Hello World\"\n                                ^\n1 error",
    "To help with your error, I need the first line of the error message. So for this example, you would copy and paste the following line into my text field",
    "\"testing.java:3: error: ';' expected\"",
    "For a runtime example, let's suppose we get the following:",
    "Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 2 out of bounds for length 2\n    at file_name.main(file_name.java:4)",
    "To help with your error, I again will need the first line of the error message. So for this example, you would copy and paste the following line into my text field",
    "\"Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 2 out of bounds for length 2\"",
    "When I receive your error message I will do my best to provide some elaboration on the error message and what might be going wrong.",
    "Now that we have gone through all of that, what is the error message that you are receiving?"
  ],
  "which_err": "Alright, what error message are you receiving?",
  "err_res": "Here is what I know about that error:",
  "err_parse_res1":"Here is the error I found that matches the form of the one you gave me:",
  "err_parse_res2":"And this is what I know about that error:",
  "examine_res":"After you have taken a moment to review the tips about the error message I gave you. Did you find it helpful for understanding the error message or debugging your code? (Your response can help me improve my answers in the future!)",
  "err_res_bad_temp":"I am sorry, I don't recognize the error you gave me. Please make sure the formatting is correct and send it to me again!",
  "err_res_bad": "I am sorry, I don't recognize the error you gave me. Would you like to try again or would you like me to review the formatting that I use?",
  "dont_have": "Hmm, it looks like I don't have that error message. I will keep note of this so that an answer can be added later! Would you like to ask about a different error message?",

  "helpful_true": "Awesome, I am glad I was able to help! Are there any other error messages I can help you with?",
  "helpful_false": "Oh no, I am sorry I wasn't able to help with that error message. Other resources you can use for help with error messages are Office Hours or Lab TAs. Is there a different error message I could help you with?",

  "goodbye": "Thank you for participating in my independent work and testing out my Lab TA chatbot!",
